\section{Jpsi and Boosted Z Control Sample}
The J/psi resonance provides a sample of particles which allow us to chech the performance of the lepton jet algorithm in real data. The muons reconstruction chosen to have high efficiency which suppressing the background significantly. A sample of simulated J/Psi events is used to study The data set is /XXXXX
LastStationAngularTight was chosen with each muon is then required to have at least one hit in the pixel detectors to remove contributions from decays-in-flight

(look at signal muon distribution to see the Pt range)
