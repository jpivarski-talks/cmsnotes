\abstract{Physics beyond the Standard Model could manifest itself by highly collimated multiple muons or electrons that result from the decay of these highly boosted resonance. A preliminary study of muon Jet algorithm is presented. In addition, di-muons from Jpsi decay collected with the CMS experiment at LHC at center-of-mass energy
of $sqrt s$=7TeV in 2010 are used to commission the Lepton Jets algorithm and show it performs as expected.
