\section{Performance of Collimated Muon reconstruction}
The feasibility of collimated muons search in CMS was evaluated first by studing the recontruction efficiency of
pair of opposite or same sign muons for varios delta R as can be seen in Fig XXX corresondigly.
The figure demonstrate the sharpe turn on curve for opposite charged muons for all  muon selectors but the stand alone muons. The reason is the XXX. 
In contrast same sign muons have a slower turn on curve as can be seen in Fig. to further investigate the ineffincy for small muon pair separation Fig shows the efficiency of same sign muons as a function of the difference in the Pt of the muons pair. Fig shows a 2D plot the efficiency as a function of the  separation in delta R vs the separtion in PT (<20).
