\section{Summary and Conclusions}
  The design and performance of collimated muon Jets in CMS have  been described.   The feasibility test of the 
CMS detector to efficiently find collimated muons have being studied and the standard Anti-Kt algorithm pefromance to cluster this tracks into a jet was evaluated.  A model independent approch was used to test the tagging efficiency of the lepton jet algorithm and finally a data MC comprison was done to evalute the algorithm efficincy using the Jpsi and Z resonances.
